# Web Page Skeleton

## Responsive Header & Footer

I followed Kevin Powell's YouTube tutorial, [Create a responsive navigation nav with no JS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QKOaTYvYUA) and created a website skeleton for future projects I complete. I intend to use this on my personal portfolio website when I get around to making a new one and am excited to not have to recreate it on every site I need to make.

I would like to add to the navigation bar with Kevin's video, [Responsive navigation with a fun animated dropdown using CSS clip-path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqbOu5ZRFag&t=1585s), but that's a project for another day.
